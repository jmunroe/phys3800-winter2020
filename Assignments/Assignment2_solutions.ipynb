    "### a. Modify your program from Problem 9.3 so that periodic boundary conditions are used, that is, $u_0 = u_N$ and $u_1=u_{N+1}$. Choose $N= 10$, and the initial condition corresponding to the normal mode (9.10) with $n= 2$. Does this initial condition yield a normal mode solution for periodic boundary conditions? (It might be easier to answer this question by plotting $u_i$ versus time for two or more particles.) For fixed boundary conditions there are $N+ 1$ springs, but for periodic boundary conditions there are $N$ springs. Why? Choose the initial condition corresponding to the $n= 2$ normal mode, but replace $N+1$ by $N$ in (9.7). Does this initial condition correspond to a normal mode? Now try $n=3$, and other values of $n$. Which values of $n$ give normal modes? Only sine functions can be normal modes for fixed boundary conditions (see (9.4)). Can there be normal modes with cosine functions if we use periodic boundary conditions?"

Choose $N=10$, and use the initial condition corresponding to the $n=3$ normal mode found using fixed boundary conditions. Does this condition correspond to a normal mode for free boundary conditions? Is $n=2$ a normal mode for free boundary conditions? Are the normal modes purely sinusoidal?"

After the pulse reaches the right end, what is the phase of the reflected pulse, that is, are the displacements in the reflected pulse in the same direction as the incoming pulse (a phase shift of zero degrees) or in the opposite direction (a phase shift of 180 degrees)?
