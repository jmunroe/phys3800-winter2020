ChooseN= 10, and the initial condition corresponding to the normalmode (9.10) withn= 2. Does this initial condition yield a normal mode solution for periodicboundary conditions? (It might be easier to answer this question by plottinguiversus time fortwo or more particles.) For fixed boundary conditions there areN+ 1 springs, but for periodicboundary conditions there areNsprings. Why? Choose the initial condition corresponding tothen= 2 normal mode, but replaceN+1 byNin (9.7). Does this initial condition correspondto a normal mode? Now tryn= 3, and other values ofn. Which values ofngive normalmodes? Only sine functions can be normal modes for fixed boundary conditions (see (9.4)).Can there be normal modes with cosine functions if we use periodic boundary conditions?"
